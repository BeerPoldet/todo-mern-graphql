# Todo application demonstration

full stack project using MERN stack + GraphQL with Test Driven Development

#### NOTE: PROJECT STILL IN PROGRESS

this project contains server and client

## Server

Server stack contains:
- GraphQL
- NodeJS

And upcoming components:
- MongoDB
- Express

For now, this project could demonstrate how to get NodeJS to provide GraphQL API without using database but in memory. As you can see, with TDD approach. It is easy to mock database behavior. See `src/index.js` for an instance. so i don't need to hard code inside my production code. but do mocking from an api user which is `src/index.js`. so next thing to go is to add database gateway without changing my existing structure. then i can code incrementally which is the nature of TDD.

## Client
UNDER CONSTRUCTION
